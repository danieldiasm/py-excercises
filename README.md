# py-exercises

This is an exercise repository for my students or anyone that wants to pratice programming in Python 3. I don't recommend it for complete begginers because there is not a lot of directions or explanations, just some hints. The difficult level will progress as the day of the exercise goes.

There are some steps that you can take to ensure some or have complete success on doing the exercises, which are:

* Cloning this repository as general directions and to grab new exercises updates on your machine.
* Making a new repo of your own to store your progression, have github activity and pratice interacting with github.
