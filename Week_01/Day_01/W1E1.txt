This is your first excercise in this series, and because of it we'll start it 
easy just to first remember or pratice some concepts.

Remember, this is NOT a excercise list for COMPLETE begginers, only begginers,
so, if you can't do it, go back two squares...

Proposal:

Make a program that:
1 - Greets you 
2 - Asks your name and age
3 - Put this info in suggestive named variables like user_name user_age.

After that... 

4 - Print it back with some nice phrase.
    But, there is more on it!

    4.1 - if this person is younger than 18, it may say something like "Too young!".

5 - At the end just say goodbye calling it by its name.

I'll give you some hints:

print()
input()
if(somecondition):

Hard part on this: Make simple variable names and organize the code propperly.
