This is your first excercise in this series, and because of it we'll start it 
easy just to first remember or pratice some concepts.

Remember, this is NOT a excercise list for COMPLETE begginers, only begginers,
so, if you can't do it, go back two squares...

Proposal:

Make a program that:
1 - Greets you 
2 - asks your name and age
3 - Put this info in a dictionary in format key:value as 'name':age.

After that... 

4 - Print it back with some nice phrase.
    But, there is more on it!

    4.1 - if this person is younger than 18, it may say something like "Too young!".

    4.2 - elif this person is older than 18 but younger than 30 says "Let's bounce!".

    4.3 - else make it say "Meh...".

5 - At the end just say goodbye calling it by its name.

I'll give you some hints:

print()
input()

some_dict = {}
some_dict[key] = 'value'

Hard part on this: Print the key value on the print.
